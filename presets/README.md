# WLED Presets

These presets are tied to IDs used by the custom usermod:

- **ID 1 - Detected:** `detected.json`  
  Red background with a blue scanning sweep overlay.

- **ID 2 - RGB Idle:** `idle.json`  
  RGB palette flow animation, visually distinct from the detected animation.

## Usage
1. In WLED UI, open **Presets** and import these JSON files.
2. Ensure they are saved under IDs **1** and **2**.  
   (The usermod calls these IDs directly.)
3. You can swap animations later by editing these presets, just keep the IDs the same.

⚠️ **Note:** OUIs in `OUIS[]` inside the sketch are **placeholders** (e.g., `AA:BB:CC`). Replace with your own OUIs if you want real filtering.

Use this firmware for the debugging and development tools such as the python visualizer or the calibration logger. Do not use this for the production usermod.
